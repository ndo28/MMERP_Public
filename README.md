# MMERP Web App

The [Marine Mammal Educational Research Program (MMERP)](https://sites.google.com/site/hsummerp/home) is Humboldt State University's internship program facilitating shore surveys of stranded marine mammals. <br />
It is part of the [West Coast Marine Mammal Stranding Network](http://www.westcoast.fisheries.noaa.gov/protected_species/marine_mammals/stranding_network.html), and therefore must meet specific reporting requirements. <br />
The goal of this project is to provide a [mobile-first web application](http://nrs-projects.humboldt.edu/~mmerp/mmerp.php) to replace the existing pen-and-paper form used by MMERP surveyors.

## Live Instance

The application is currently available, but is being served by a temporary, student project server and may become unavailable at any time. <br />
Please use the following URL, username, and password for any testing in the live instance.
