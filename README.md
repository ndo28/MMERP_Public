# The_Bang_Show

The [Marine Mammal Educational Research Program (MMERP)](https://sites.google.com/site/hsummerp/home) is Humboldt State University's internship program facilitating shore surveys of stranded marine mammals.
It is part of the [West Coast Marine Mammal Stranding Network](http://www.westcoast.fisheries.noaa.gov/protected_species/marine_mammals/stranding_network.html), and therefore must meet specific reporting requirements.
The goal of this project is to provide a [mobile-first web application](http://nrs-projects.humboldt.edu/~mmerp/mmerp.php) to replace the existing pen-and-paper form used by MMERP surveyors.
