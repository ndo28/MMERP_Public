Our second iteration will involve creating the web interface to access, create,
edit, and view reports. This will be the interface through which both users and admins
will use the application. We will implement functionality to create new reports,
edit existing reports,

  * admin_report_by_date: to unit test we will write a sql query
                          which will provide reports by date.

  * admin_report_by_surveyor: to unit test we will write a sql query
                              which will provide reports by surveyor.

  * admin_report_by_coordinate: to unit test we will write a sql query
                                which will provide reports by coordinates.

  Acceptance testing will include running multiple SQL queries to test
  the functionality of database to generate accurate results.
