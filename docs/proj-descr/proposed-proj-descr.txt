Marine Mammal and Research education program(MMERP) is an internship program for both undergrad and graduate students
at Humboldt State, MMERP has grown from only surveying locals gray whales to surveying numerous marine mammals throughout northern
California.

MMERP's primary focus is to develop survey and sampling protocols for stranded marine life.

 -The MMERP website.

We are facing a problem with students reporting the findings on their beach walks. We are currently
using a paper trail system, which results in loss of data, skewed results in our research, and general inefficiency
of communication.

The proposed solution is to create a mobile application which would allow students on beach walks to
instantly upload their current location via GPS, as well as images and a description of their findings.
The uploaded information will be stored online to be accessed by MMERP researchers.
