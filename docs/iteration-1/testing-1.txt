Our first iteration involved creating the surveyor database and
populating the database with sample data provided by the client.
Our unit testing went as follows for each of the user stories:

  * admin_report_by_date: to unit test we used the project_db_test1.sql file
                          which provided reports by date. The output
                          of these test files went to project-db-test1.txt

  * admin_report_by_surveyor: to unit test we used the project_db_test1.sql file
                              which provided reports by surveyor. The output
                              of these test files went to project-db-test1.txt

  * admin_report_by_coordinate: to unit test we used the project_db_test1.sql file
                                which provided reports by coordinates. The output
                                of these test files went to project-db-test1.txt

  Acceptance testing will include running multiple SQL queries to test
  the functionality of database to generate accurate results.
