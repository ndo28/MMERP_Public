Our first iteration will involve creating the survey database and
populating the database with sample data provided by the client.
Our unit testing will be as follow for each of the user stories:

  * admin_report_by_date: to unit test we will write a sql query
                          which will provide reports by date.

  * admin_report_by_surveyor: to unit test we will write a sql query
                              which will provide reports by surveyor.

  * admin_report_by_coordinate: to unit test we will write a sql query
                                which will provide reports by coordinates.

  Acceptance testing will include running multiple SQL queries to test
  the functionality of database to generate accurate results.
