We think our testing methods for iteration 2 were sufficient,
so we won't be changing our methods, simply updating them for our
current user stories.

Our third iteration consists mainly of minor tweaks, additions, and
changes based on feedback from our client. The changes are summarized
in our current user stories, as listed below.

  * Surveyor_photo: To unit test, we will submit reports containing photos
                    as a surveyor. We will then log in as admin, and view
                    the reports to confirm the photos uploaded properly.

  * Admin_add_user: To unit test, we will log in as admin, and add a new user.
                    We will then log in to SQL and view the Users table to confirm
                    the addition was successful.

  * Admin_edit_user: To unit test, we will log in as admin, and edit information for the user
                     added previously. We will then log in to SQL and view the Users table
                     to confirm the edit was successful.

  * Admin_remove_user: To unit test, we will log in as admin, and delete the user we added previously.
                       We will then log in to SQL and view the Users table to confirm
                       removal was successful.

  * Admin_view_by_species: To unit test, we will log in as admin, and navigate to the admin console.
                           In the admin console there will be an option to view reports by species. We
                           will select a beach we know has report submitted, and compare the results
                           to the contents of the Reports table in SQL.

For acceptance testing, we will meet with our client, and verify
that our program meets requirements and expectations. We will also
run through each possible branch of the program, and validate that
everything is working properly.
