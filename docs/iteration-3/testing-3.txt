Testing 3:

* Admin_add_user: To unit testing, we will logged in as admin, and add a new user.
                  Then we logged in to SQL and viewed the Users table and confirmed
                  the addition was successful.

* Admin_edit_user: To unit test, we will logged in as admin, and edited information for the user
                   added previously. We logged in to SQL and viewed the Users table
                   to confirm the edit was successful.

* Admin_remove_user: To unit test, we will logged in as admin, and deleted the user we added previously.
                     We then logged in to SQL and viewed the Users table to confirm
                     removal was successful.

* Admin_view_by_species: To unit test, we logged in as admin, and navigated to the admin console.
                         In the admin console there is option to view reports by species. We
                         selected a beach we know has report submitted, and compared the results
                         to the contents of the Reports table in SQL.
